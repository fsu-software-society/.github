Students can also have the ability to expand on their classwork for projects they have done in class. 
Without breaching academic integrity, we encourage students to expand upon the projects they already have built for their classes.

Example:
Calculator for not only arithmetic operations but also notation such as PostFix Prefix etc with certain given inputs
